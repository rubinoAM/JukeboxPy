# Python Jukebox

Around the time that my mother's old boss at Chase Auto Finance had moved to Arizona, he had given my mother an old jukebox of his as a gift since his wife would not allow him to take it with them on their move. The jukebox soon became a treasured item in our family, and ever since then I've been enamored by the jukebox as a piece of technology.

As a way of testing my abilities with Python, I decided to make a jukebox application of sorts using a record collection of my own choosing stored within nested dictionaries. It has been a fun process figuring out how to loop through such a complicated nesting setup, and I've certainly learned a lot about loops and parsing through nested dictionaries.

That being said, perhaps the data structure for this application was too convoluted for what I was trying to accomplish. Such is the way when experimenting with a new language, I suppose.

I would like to re-tool this program into something sleeker and more stylish in appearance in the future. Perhaps I'll even try recreating it in another language. Until then, all I can say is that this program was fun to build and to learn from.

The first build was finished on November 28th of 2018.
